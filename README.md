# React-Weather-App
I created react-weather-app which will display 5 Days of forecast by using weather API

It contains dropdown to select 3 cities from Maharashtra e.g:(Mumbai, Pune, Nashik) then a button to fetch the next 5 days forecast.

Technologies used are...

1.React JS.

2.Weather API.

3.React hook (react-fetch-hook) for conveniently use Fetch API.

4.React Bootstrap (Button,Form(select),Grids,Cards etc).

5.DOM for adding Dark/Light mode effect.
